            <ol>
              <li>A player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".</li>
              <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
              <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
